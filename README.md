# Deriving ENSO from Sea Surface Temperature Using PCA

This repository accompanies the blog post on using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), an undupervised learning method, to uncover dominant spatial and temporal patterns in sea surface temperature (SST), including the El NiÃ±oâ€“Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The analysis demonstrates how mathematical decomposition alone can reveal complex and meaningful climate signals without prior labeling.

## Overview

The code in this repository:

- Downloads and preprocesses NOAA ERSSTv5 sea surface temperature data from 1854â€“2024.
- Applies PCA to extract dominant modes of SST variability across the equatorial Pacific.
- Visualizes the first three principal components as time series and spatial reconstructions.
- Compares the second PC to a derived NiÃ±o 3.4 index to show alignment with ENSO behavior.
- Animates SST projections onto the first three principal axes.
- Reconstructs the SST field using only the top three components to show dimensionality reduction.
